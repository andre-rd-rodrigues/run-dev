# ðŸ“‚ Run dev CLI ðŸ“‚

## Description

This is a CLI tool for running `npm run dev` on a selected project folder. It will prompt the user to select a project folder from a list of folders located in the `~/git` directory. Once a folder is selected, it will open the folder in your default IDE (e.g. VS Code) and launch the `npm run dev` command on the folder using the default shell. It also pipes the output of the command to the parent process.

## Installation

You can install this tool via npm:

`npm i -g @andrerodrigo/run-dev`

## Usage

To run the CLI tool, simply type `dev` in your terminal. The tool will prompt you to select a project folder from a list of folders, located in the `~/git` directory, with a `package.json` file and the `npm run dev` script. Once you select a folder, it will open the folder in your IDE and launch the `npm run dev` command on the folder using the default shell.

To stop the `npm run dev` command, press `CTRL+C` in the terminal.
